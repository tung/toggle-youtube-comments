Toggle YouTube Comments
=======================

This Chrome extension is a modified version of [JamieH's one](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fcfhbkjlcdfcalpimjcpmgacnopdfjcf), which toggles comment visibility with a button under the video, next to the flag. Unlike that one, this version toggles nothing other than comments, so page layout doesn't jump about when you click the button.

Installing
----------

Click 'Downloads' at the top-right of the GitHub page and choose 'toggle-youtube-comments.crx'.

Alternately, clone this repo and point Chrome's extensions page to its directory in developer mode.
